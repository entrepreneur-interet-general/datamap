#+title: Datamap: build simple data tables collaboratively

* Mission

Datamap is a simple interface to let several users build a simple data
table collaboratively.

Datamap aims at being used as an upstream tool for Dataroom and other
similar data exposure tools.

* Requirements

- [ ] Create a user by using an email address.
- [ ] Restrict user creation by matching against allowed emails adresses.
- [ ] A user can CRUD a list of data sets (for which sheâ€™s an admin).
- [ ] A list admin can accept/add/remove users from a list.
- [ ] An authorized user can CRUD data sets to a list.
- [ ] Each list is exposed as =json=: =https://[service]/[list].json=
